# MaliciousURLDetectionUsingML

The most common method to detect malicious URLs deployed by many antivirus groups is the black-list method. Black-lists are essentially a database of URLs that have been confirmed to be malicious in the past. The main limitation is that it is almost impossible to maintain an 
exhaustive list of malicious URLs, especially since new URLs are generated rapidly.
The malicious and benign URLs differ in their lexical features which would be used in classifying the URLs as malicious or non-malicious. 
The approach would be to extract the lexical features in real time for classifying the URL to be malicious or non malicious using machine 
learning classification algorithms.

OBJECTIVES
1. To perform an analysis of different URL features and components.
2. To build a machine learning classifier to detect and classify the malicious and benign web
   pages.
3. To overcome limitations of traditional approaches such as blacklist methods to detect
   malicious web pages.
4. To deploy our model as an API so that it can be used by the end users. The aim would be
   to use the modelâ€™s API in a Chrome extension for real time classification.
